# 365 Data Science user journey
In this User Journey Analysis project, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of real-world data sourced from 365’s online subscription-based learning platform. The primary objective was to dissect and analyze user behavior, focusing on the concept of 'user journey'—the unique experience each user undergoes while navigating through the platform. Specifically, I delved into the sequence of pages that users visited before making the pivotal decision to subscribe to the platform.

The significance of this analysis lies in its ability to unveil key pages or sequences that play a crucial role in converting users into paying customers. By deciphering user behavior, businesses can refine their marketing strategies and identify any superfluous pages that may impede a seamless user experience.

My task in this project was to construct the requisite tools and functions in Python for the systematic analysis of diverse users' website journeys. This necessitated thoughtful consideration of the necessary components and strategic planning on how to achieve the desired outcomes.

The dataset provided, named 'user_journey_raw.csv,' contained essential information about the journeys of numerous users. It included columns such as user and session IDs, the purchased plan (Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual), and a user journey string for each session. The user journey string represented the sequence of pages visited during the session, ordered and separated by dashes.
